## Defining The Problem

### Problem Space

In the past several months, many of us are either experiencing lock-down or voluntarily following the social distancing rules to minimise our time spent outside due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, players of all ages and backgrounds have embraced the power of play through video games. _\(_[_Entertainment Software Association, 2020_](reference-list.md#entertainment-software-association-2020-essential-facts-online-available-at-https-www-theesa-com-wp-content-uploads-2020-07-final-edited-2020-esa_essential_facts-pdf)_\)_

There are more than 214 million video game players across the United States, three quarters of all U.S. households have at least one person who plays video games, and 64 percent of U.S. adults and 70 percent of those under 18 regularly play video games.  80 percent of players say video games provide mental stimulation, with 79 percent saying it provides relaxation_\(_[_Entertainment Software Association, 2020_](reference-list.md#entertainment-software-association-2020-essential-facts-online-available-at-https-www-theesa-com-wp-content-uploads-2020-07-final-edited-2020-esa_essential_facts-pdf)_\)._ Amazon-owned Twitch, where people watch other people play video games in live webcasts, chatting in real time with the streamer and other viewers, clocked five billion hours of viewed content in the second quarter of 2020 alone. The engagement is an 83% increase from last year._\(_[_May, 2020_](reference-list.md#may-e-2020-streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q2-2020-live-streaming-industry-report-online-medium-available-at-https-blog-streamlabs-com-streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q-2-2020-live-streaming-industry-report-44298-e0d-15-bc-accessed-11-mar-2021)_\)._

In the field of game studies scholars have explored game playing experiences \([Azadvar & Dalqvist, 2020](reference-list.md#azadvar-a-and-dalqvist-e-2020-aging-agents-cross-generational-analysis-of-behavior-and-need-satisfaction-among-players-of-tom-clancys-the-division-2-the-computer-games-journal-9-2-pp-245-262)_\)_ For example, players may experience deep meaningful game experiences through role-playing games, whereas simulation or puzzle games may not elicit the same experience \([Connell & Dunlap, 2020](reference-list.md#connell-m-and-dunlap-k-2020-you-are-the-one-foretold-finding-yourself-through-the-journey-in-r-kowert-ed-online-springer-international-publishing-pp-125-140-available-at-https-doi-org-10-1007-978-3-030-32770-59)\). It is also important to understand the role of player motivations on game experience. If a player is highly motivated to achieve, then Incorporating gamification elements that provide feedback on progress, such as goals rewards and leader boards, could influence their gaming experience exponentially \([Deterding, 2011](reference-list.md#deterding-s-2011-meaningful-play-coding-conduct-online-codingconduct-cc-available-at-https-codingconduct-cc-meaningful-play-accessed-12-mar-2021-if-a-player-is-highly-motivated-to-achieve-then-incorporating-gamification-elements-that-provide-feedback-on-progress-such-as-goals-rewards-and-leader-boards-could-influence-their-gaming-experience-exponentially)\). Understanding the purpose or motivations of a gamer can afford the game design to be tailored specifically, especially if you are planning to design a game aimed at a specific audience \([De Schutter, 2010](reference-list.md#de-schutter-b-and-brown-j-a-2015-digital-games-as-a-source-of-enjoyment-in-later-life-games-and-culture-11-1-2-pp-28-52-it-is-also-important-to-understand-the-role-of-player-motivations-on-game-experience-if-a-player-is-highly-motivated-to-achieve-then-incorporating-gamification-elements-that-provide-feedback-on-progress-such-as-goals-rewards-and-leader-boards-could-influence-their-gaming-experience-exponentially);  [Marston et al., 2015](reference-list.md#marston-h-r-and-kowert-r-2020-what-role-can-videogames-play-in-the-covid-19-pandemic-emerald-open-research-online-2-p-34-available-at-https-emeraldopenresearch-com-articles-2-34-v-2-pdf-article_uuid-4-ff-8635-c-b-0-fb-43-fa-b-20-d-c-38-bfeee6594-accessed-11-mar-2021)\) or rationale. Therefore, understanding the motivations of the target audience is important for game design  and potential positive outcomes via gameplay. \([De Schutter and Brown, 2015](reference-list.md#de-schutter-b-and-brown-j-a-2015-digital-games-as-a-source-of-enjoyment-in-later-life-games-and-culture-11-1-2-pp-28-52-it-is-also-important-to-understand-the-role-of-player-motivations-on-game-experience-if-a-player-is-highly-motivated-to-achieve-then-incorporating-gamification-elements-that-provide-feedback-on-progress-such-as-goals-rewards-and-leader-boards-could-influence-their-gaming-experience-exponentially)\)
